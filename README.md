## About me
I am driven by an unquenchable passion for using data and technology to drive positive transformations. My professional journey is guided by curiosity and a deep-seated belief in the power of innovation to address the environmental, social, and economic challenges of our time. As a Program Manager for Data & Innovations and a former management consultant at PwC, I've had the privilege to work on transformative projects that harness the potential of data. Whether it's designing data platforms to enhance healthcare access in rural Kenya or facilitate civil service reforms in pre-conflict Sudan, my work is fueled by a relentless commitment to making a meaningful impact. My multifaceted background in Industrial Engineering, Accounting, Business Management, coupled with certifications as a PMI Project Management Professional (PMP) and Data Management, equips me to wear multiple hats as an entrepreneur, project manager, and technology thought leader.
