## Profile
Passionate about Data, Analytics, and Agile Project Management, I leverage these domains to craft innovative tech solutions that meet environmental, social, and economic needs. As the Program Manager for Data & Innovations and a former management consultant at PwC, I've spearheaded technology and data initiatives both in Africa and Europe, collaborating with businesses, governments, international NGOs, and development partners. Notably, I've designed data platforms to bolster health service delivery in rural Kenya and facilitate civil service reforms in pre-conflict Sudan. These ventures have sharpened my expertise in Program and Project Management, Design Thinking, Data Analytics, Data Product Management, and Business Analytics. With an Industrial Engineering background, I hold certifications as a PMI Project Management Professional (PMP) and a Certified Data Leader. I wear multiple hats: entrepreneur, project manager, and technology thought leader.

In this role, I ensure the design, development, communication, implementation, monitoring, and adaptive management of strategic data and technology innovations, including data and analytics for FSC evaluation and learning. During my tenure, I recruited talented and highly motivated individuals to join the FSC's data and innovations team. I ensured proactive resolution of demands for data and analytics through the design and development of data solutions (reports and dashboards). Using design thinking, we built customer-centric data products, provided training and capacity building to users through focus groups, workshops, and Info Sessions, and tracked user engagement and user sentiments with our data products.

I successfully did project management, Monitoring & Evaluation, and change management of transformational initiatives for various clients. I contributed to several international development projects commissioned by the World Bank, USAID, UNICEF, KfW, GIZ, and DANIDA in different locations such as Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Kampala, Somaliland, and Khartoum. I also demonstrated leadership skills in business development and business management initiatives.
